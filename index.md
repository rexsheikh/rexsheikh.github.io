[Project Proposal](./projectProposal.md)


# Background and Getting Started 
  Welcome! The primary goal of this site is to communicate progress on a summer-long project whose purpose is twofold: build professional skills and explore my current interests and goals. Read on for weekly updates to this end to see this project's genesis to completion.


## Post 1 (05.31.2025)
First, I spent some time familiarizing myself with the course structure and expectations which included watching the course origins video and learning about past projects. I was grateful to see past projects were indeed wide-ranging and seemed to be tailored toward student interest. I’ve never worked without at least some constraints, so I immediately found myself nearly lost in potential projects I might find interesting. I decided to set some parameters at this point to narrow the decision-making process. In rank order, here is the criteria I came up with:

1. **Interesting** – Making something tailored to my interests for credit is not only a unique opportunity but should make progress feel less like homework and more like genuine exploration.
2. **Feasible** – I won’t be solving cold fusion. Whatever I decide to make will need to be executable within (roughly) 40 hours of dedicated work. I should have a fair degree of confidence, based on prior projects and academic work, that I can reach a minimum viable product.
3. **Challenging** – If I expect to learn something, I should also expect to run into things I haven’t seen before. This clashes with (2), but I think I can find a balance.
4. **Extendable** – A project that can naturally support additions later on removes the pressure of doing everything this summer. A project that is inherently limited in scope might stifle momentum if I want to explore different aspects of a language, framework, or technology.

I’ve already made a good deal of progress this week with the above criteria. The specifics of eliminating potential projects to land on just a few candidates included a fair amount of research and unexciting details of which I’ll spare the reader. I had no problem thinking of interesting projects, but balancing the next three criteria was much harder.

I decided that I want to learn more about cloud-based services, specifically AWS. I have some experience with React, but my last foray did not instill confidence. Lastly, I wanted to integrate a physics engine for simple 2D games, and after some searching found Matter.js to be a prime candidate. A natural project, then, would be a game or suite of games that leveraged Matter.js to render game pieces while using popular AWS services like Cognito, S3, and Lambda for authentication, storage, and game logic respectively. I plan to learn more about these, decide which games to implement, and build a schedule that captures the project scope

__Are there any impediments in your way__

My impediments right now include a lack of familiarity with chosen technologies, frameworks, and libraries. I am stepping through React tutorials, familiarizing myself with the AWS console, and tinkering with some of the demo code for Matter.js. Also, I need to decide which games to pursue. Their logic should be straightforward and unambiguous. It’s not that these games are secondary, but I need to focus on core functionality rather than a brand new game whose logic is undefined. I’ve found defining that logic to be hugely consequential and nonintuitive in the past and I would like to avoid getting bogged down there. I am thinking of making clones of popular 2D mobile games or boardgames right now.

__Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better__

The initial list of potential projects was quite long and I began to explore each one without method or reason. It was a frantic, unorganized combination of Google searches, notebook sketches, and other references. It had been several hours before I stopped myself to realize this was far from efficient. I have a tendency to do this, look at the nearest clock, and say “wow, I did not achieve nearly as much as I’d hoped today.” So, in terms of process I’m aiming to take a wider view of the problem and approach it methodically.

## Post 2 (06.05.2025)

Last week included refining my project scope to better define what exactly the minimum viable product will look like. This included some references to what I know about React and chosen AWS technologies to determine if I can confidently implement features efficiently. After, and as a part of the project proposal, I built a schedule.

This next week, I plan to move forward with that schedule by finalizing game logic and starting the React frontend and some basic tests using Matter.js. Also, I'd like to refine my project website to include some more background into the project's motivation.

I was pretty happy with my process this week. Splitting time between making a schedule, writing the project proposal, and reading references to not only learn about these new technologies but write a schedule I am confident with felt productive.

I don't have any impediments right now, although the volume of material to get through and learn feels daunting at the moment.

## Post 3 (06.12.2025)

Last weeek I started to build an understanding of Matter.js to implement some simple features while creating a rough scaffolding of the site. I focused on getting some early wins with a simple navigation bar in React and a simple penduluum demo to get a feel for how Matter.js renders objects to apply physical constants. The most difficult piece, though, was setting up React and learning how to create and consume components. The syntax is not straightforward to me and there are more curly braces than I care for. Still, it became very apparent to me why React is so popular. The investment upfront to build a good component does indeed make them highly reusable and easily configurable. I spent this week refining my understanding of React by completing some tutorials, notably a tic-tac-toe game that shows how to use state. I also did a great deal of research in AWS integration. I expect some difficulties integrating the frontend and backend and I've found time spent with familiarization saves time in implementation in these cases. 

My process was good this week, although I'm feeling a bit behind. Moving forward, I hope to increase the frequency between learning something and testing a simple implementation. The simple demos integrated with React proved that to me and it felt like my time was better spent there rather than reading docs and doing tutorials for a considerable amount of time. I have to remind myself that this software can break and proper version control via git offers rollbacks to safe points of progress. 

I don't have any significant impediments, but like I mentioned before, accelerating the learning to testing cycle frequency would more efficiently chip away at the volume of material I have to move through.
