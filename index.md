# About Me
 First, welcome! I'm glad you decided to stop by. A bit about me and this page: my interest in programming and computing began at an early age. I have early memories of unboxing the family's Gateway computer, installing Star Wars Episode I Racer, and feeling genuine excitement when friends and family would respond to emails from my AOL account. My email inbox brings considerably less excitement these days, but I still love to game and my interests in programming and computing in general have evolved through academic and professional experiences. 

I was drawn towards math and physics in high school and later studied mechanical engineering at USMA. Any class that integrated MATLAB scripts or CAD modeling quickly became my favorites. I served in the Army afterwards and quickly saw obvious and impactful uses for programming. We had several manual input, error prone systems that were ripe for automation. Though I struggled at first, I saw how a well-designed program could deliver not only major time savings but also better outcomes overall. I was sold. I decided to study computer science after the Army to learn more about the field while building technical skills along the way. 

I've found the journey thus far to be challenging but rewarding. The breadth and depth of the field can feel overwhelming but I'm grateful for the progress I've made so far.
